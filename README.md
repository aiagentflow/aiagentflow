# aiagentflow

A local-first CLI that orchestrates multi-agent AI workflows for software development. Give it a task — or feed it your specs, PRDs, and guidelines — and it coordinates specialized agents to architect, code, review, test, and ship automatically.

**No cloud dependency. Bring your own API keys. Your code stays on your machine.**

## How It Works

```
Task → Architect → Coder → Reviewer → Tester → Fixer → Ship
```

Each stage uses a specialized AI agent with tuned prompts and parameters. The loop repeats until quality thresholds pass — like a small AI engineering team running on your machine.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @aiagentflow/cli
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @aiagentflow/cli
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
aiagentflow init

# 2. Run a task
aiagentflow run "Add a login form with email/password validation"

# 3. Or run autonomously (no approval prompts)
aiagentflow run "Refactor the auth module" --auto

# 4. Feed context docs to agents
aiagentflow run "Add auth" --context docs/api-spec.md docs/security.md

# 5. Generate a task list from specs, then batch-run
aiagentflow plan docs/prd.md -o tasks.txt
aiagentflow run --batch tasks.txt --auto
```

The `init` wizard walks you through:

1. Select your LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama)
2. Enter API keys
3. Assign models per agent role
4. Set workflow preferences
5. Import existing docs (specs, requirements, guidelines) for auto-loading

Configuration is saved locally in `.aiagentflow/config.json`.

## Features

- **Multi-agent pipeline** — 6 specialized agents, each with a distinct role
- **Context-aware** — feed specs, PRDs, architecture docs, and guidelines to every agent
- **Plan from docs** — generate batch-ready task lists from your existing documentation
- **Local-first** — runs entirely on your machine, no code leaves your system
- **Provider-agnostic** — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Ollama (local models), more coming
- **Configurable** — tune models, temperature, and iteration limits per agent
- **Git-native** — auto-creates branches for each task
- **Human-in-the-loop** — approve or override at any stage, or go full auto
- **QA policies** — configurable quality gates (max critical issues, test requirements)
- **Batch mode** — process multiple tasks from a file
- **Session persistence** — crash recovery with automatic session saving
- **Token tracking** — monitor LLM usage per agent and per run
- **Customizable prompts** — edit agent prompts in `.aiagentflow/prompts/`

## Supported Providers

| Provider      | Type      | Setup                                                 |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anthropic** | Cloud API | Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                          |
| **OpenAI**    | Cloud API | Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`                             |
| **Ollama**    | Local     | Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally |

More providers (Groq, etc.) can be added by implementing a single adapter file.

### Using with Ollama (free, local)

```bash
# Install and start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Initialize aiagentflow with Ollama
aiagentflow init
# → Select "ollama" as provider
# → Enter model name: llama3.2
```

### Using with OpenAI (cloud API)

```bash
# Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Initialize aiagentflow with OpenAI
aiagentflow init
# → Select "openai" as provider
# → Enter your API key
# → Choose a model: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, or gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Available OpenAI models:

- `gpt-4o` - Most capable model, 128K context
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Fast and cost-effective, 128K context
- `gpt-4-turbo` - High performance, 128K context
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fast and affordable, 16K context

## Configuration

After `aiagentflow init`, your project has:

```
.aiagentflow/
├── config.json              # Main configuration
├── prompts/                 # Customizable agent prompts
│   ├── architect.md
│   ├── coder.md
│   ├── reviewer.md
│   ├── tester.md
│   ├── fixer.md
│   └── judge.md
├── policies/                # Quality standards
│   └── coding-standards.md
├── context/                 # Reference docs (auto-loaded into every run)
│   ├── api-spec.md          # Example: your API specification
│   └── requirements.md      # Example: your PRD or requirements
└── sessions/                # Saved workflow sessions
```

Edit the prompt files to customize how each agent behaves. Edit `coding-standards.md` to set project-specific rules that all agents follow. Drop `.md` or `.txt` files into `context/` and they'll be automatically included as reference material for all agents.

---

## Context Documents

Agents work best when they understand your project's requirements, API contracts, and standards. There are three ways to provide reference documents:

**1. Auto-loaded (recommended)** — Drop files into `.aiagentflow/context/`:

```bash
cp docs/api-spec.md .aiagentflow/context/
cp docs/security-guidelines.md .aiagentflow/context/
aiagentflow run "Implement user registration"
# Both docs are automatically included in every agent's context
```

**2. Per-run via `--context` flag:**

```bash
aiagentflow run "Add OAuth support" --context docs/oauth-spec.md docs/auth-arch.md
```

**3. During init** — The setup wizard asks if you have existing docs and copies them for you.

### What to include

| Document type          | Example             | Why it helps                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| API specs              | `api-spec.md`       | Agents generate correct endpoints and contracts   |
| Requirements / PRDs    | `requirements.md`   | Architect plans match your actual requirements    |
| Security guidelines    | `security.md`       | Reviewer catches violations against your policies |
| Architecture docs      | `architecture.md`   | Coder follows your patterns and conventions       |
| Development guidelines | `dev-guidelines.md` | All agents follow your team's standards           |

### Plan command

Turn documentation into an actionable task list, then batch-run it:

```bash
# Generate tasks from a PRD
aiagentflow plan docs/prd.md -o tasks.txt

# Review the generated tasks
cat tasks.txt

# Run them all
aiagentflow run --batch tasks.txt --auto --context docs/architecture.md
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork** the repo and clone your fork
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Follow the coding standards:**
   - Functions: `camelCase`, Classes: `PascalCase`, Files: `kebab-case`
   - All public functions need JSDoc, types, and error handling
   - Use custom `AppError` subclasses — never raw `throw new Error()`
4. **Check your work:** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`
5. **Open a PR** against `main` with a description of what and why

### Architecture rules

- Dependency direction flows downward: `cli → core → utils → types`
- Config types are inferred from Zod schemas, never manually defined
- New providers only require one adapter file + registry entry
